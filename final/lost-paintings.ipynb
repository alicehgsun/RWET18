    "The “fixed” random choice will be used to generate something that must be consistent over a painting. For example, if it’s a portrait painting: the main character in the painting should be mentioned consistently in the description. If the character has synonyms to refer, they will be fully used as well. However, such aspects as adjectives, verbs, and events don’t have to be repeated, and rather encouraged to be randomized every moment.\n",

here
it is dawn eternally
hour of awakening
hour of revolutionary prophecy
hour of the embers dead
time of the days work
without end

there we built the night
as we lit the fire
lay down in it
pulled up the dark as blanket

near fields were
the breath of animals asleep
quiet as the earth
warm as the fire

cold is the pain of believing
warmth will never return

here
night is time forgotten
eternal dawn
and in the cold I dream
	of how the pine
	burnt like
	a dogâ€™s tongue
	behind its teeth

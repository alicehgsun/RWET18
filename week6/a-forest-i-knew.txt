let me die like this

the branches have muscles
	hills get up
the cloud pours
	into a cup

in the forest wild boar
	have eaten
		are warm
			and sleepy

each clearing is recorded
	on a screen I carry
rolled like a cloth
	in my head
a sheet
	pulled over
		the eyes of the dead
keeps out the look of the world
on the cloth
	unrolled
I follow their spoor
	in the forest I knew.

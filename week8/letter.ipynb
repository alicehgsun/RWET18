    "# Letter from the Trial\n",
    "\n",
    "A rewriting generator of the letter from Alice in Wonderland, Chapter 12. The original letter itself is a poem full of pronouns, plays again with the ambiguity of pronouns. In the story, it was used as an item that proves the king's unjust and poor reasoning. Using that ambiguity, the generator will realign the original poem with [shmarkov](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/14cb94ce539a868e6b8714dd84003f06) and create new ones."
